# word-scramble-solver
Solves Boggle-style word scramble games with a words stored in a trie.

When the main method in Driver is run, it generates a random board with 
at least 250 words present, and one word of length 10. It then prints 
this board, and all of the words present in the board (sorted by length).

To manually input a board, edit the main method to create a ScrambleGrid
generated by readGrid().
